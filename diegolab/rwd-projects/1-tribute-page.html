                        Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
                        pest-resistent plants.

                        applied science.

                        to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
                        strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on
                        Earth.

                        strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.

                        - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
                        modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that
                        GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and
                        animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best
                        breeds."
